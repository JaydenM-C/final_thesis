First and foremost, I wish to thank my phenomenal supervisor, colleague and friend, Erich Round. To Erich, thank you so much for your invaluable mentorship, all the tea times, and your willingness to indulge my occasional thought bubbles. Thank you also to fellow supervisor, Simon Greenhill, for your guidance and expertise and for the incredible opportunities afforded to me. I feel so fortunate to have worked with two such exceptional people. Thank you also to Ilana Mushin and Barbara Hanna for your support and feedback, and keeping my candidature on track. Naturally, any outstanding deficiencies in my work remain my own.

Undoubtedly, one of the most rewarding aspects of this PhD program has been the wonderful friends and colleagues I've spent time with along the way. Thank you to Mitch Browne, Brian Collins, Jacqui Cook, Vivien Dunn, Tom Ennever, Claire Gourlay, Amanda Hamilton-Holloway, Jordan Hollis, Celeste Humphris, Edith Kirlew, David Osgarby, Martin Schweinberger, Janet Watts and Ruihua Yin. Thank you also to Rikker Dockum, Vanya Kapitonov, Nay San, Sasha Wilmoth, and fellow friends and classmates from the 2016 Quantitative Methods Spring School, 2017 LSA Summer Institute, CoEDL Summer Schools, and various conferences. Inevitably, there will be more people that I've missed, but I truly appreciate every one.

I owe endless thanks to my family for their boundless love and support, without which none of this would be possible. Credit must also go also to my friends outside of academia for their role in keeping me healthy, happy and grounded. This thesis could not have happened without a break for parkrun and pancakes on a Saturday morning.

Final thanks are reserved for my wife, Brittany. Thank you for your heroic support, patience and everything else.
