\chapter{Supplementary information for Chapter 6}

Files associated with model testing for binary phonotactic characters are stored in a directory called "PN\_treebuilding\_LFS" on UQ's research data management system. This is a temporary solution for the purpose of my Thesis Review milestone. When the analysis is complete, I will deposit everything publicly and give it a DOI, most likely on Zenodo. The link to the UQ RDM record is  \href{https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/index.php/s/CNfJKL68dKYPJYL}{https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/index.php/s/CNfJKL68dKYPJYL}. The system forces password protection. The password for this link is "thesisreview".
