% Thesis Content
%****************************************************
\mainmatter

%Each chapter is a separate .tex file. Use \input to load them here, as demonstrated below for Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.
%We recommend keeping each in a separate subfolder, with its accompanying figures, etc. This is how the template is currently structured.
%If you wish to divide your thesis into parts (each containing multiple chapters), us the \part{} command.

%CHAPTER 1
\input{./01-introduction/01-introduction.tex}

%CHAPTER 2
\input{./02-literature-review/02-literature-review.tex}

%CHAPTER 3
\input{./03-phoneme-frequencies/03-phoneme-frequencies.tex}

%CHAPTER 4

%CHAPTER 5

%CHAPTER 7

%CHAPTER 8

% HOW TO ADD ADDITIONAL CHAPTERS
% Step One: Add a new folder called "ChapterX" (X being the chapter number).
% Step Two: Within the folder add a new .tex file by clicking the "New File" button in the Overleaf Menu. Rename the file to a title of your choice.
% Step Three: Copy the Chapter 2 headline and "\input" command located above and insert it below Chapter 2.
% Step Four: Rename the headline to your specific chapter number, change the input command to include the name of the folder you created and the name of the file you created.
% Repeat this process for every chapter.

% Bibliography
%****************************************************
%CHOOSE YOUR BIB STYLE AND FILE.
%We have included the following two referencing styles for you to use in your thesis. You can add an alternate style if you prefer.

%Style: apalike = this is an (Author, Year) referencing style similar to APA
%Style: elsarticle-num = this is a numbered referencing style that will display the bibliography in citation order

%To use one of the styles provided ensure the % is removed from the start of the line, and the other option is commented out with a % at the start of the line. The style elsarticle-num is active by default.

%\bibliographystyle{apalike}
%\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-num}

%\bibliography{./References/Bibliography}
\printbibliography

%When you have finished your thesis we recommend that you manually fix any errors in your bibliography. 
%To do this, compile, copy the .bbl into a new .tex file and include this here after commenting out the other bibliography commands. Make corrections in that .tex file.

% ***************************************************
% Appendices
%**************************************************** 
%UNCOMMENT THIS SECTION IF YOU ARE USING APPENDICES.
%Simply adapt the same formatting used for other chapters.
\appendix
% If you need appendix in your thesis then consider the following appendix file (you can add more if you need more) otherwise you should not consider it in your main thesis.
\include{./Appendix-A/Appendix-A.tex}
\include{./Appendix-A/Appendix-B.tex}
\include{./Appendix-A/Appendix-C.tex}
