Human languages show immense structural variation across the globe. This structural variation we observe is the manifestation of thousands of years of diachronic processes. Through tracing these processes, we can infer the shared linguistic origins of different languages, a burgeoning subfield termed linguistic phylogenetics. In concert with evidence from other fields such as archaeology, ecology and anthropology, and utilising powerful computational methods from biology, it is possible piece together deep-time hypotheses on human history, i.e. who was talking to who, when, where and why.

A critical foundation in the methodological arsenal for tackling these questions is a sound understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of linguistic structures. Access to structural data at scale, including from resource-poor linguistic areas, is also essential for progressing beyond the current bottleneck in historical linguistic data acquisition, which is largely still a manual process. This thesis investigates the evolutionary dynamics of structural linguistic variation within sound systemsâ€”specifically, phonotactics (the language-specific set of rules that govern how sounds combine into words and syllables). 

This thesis presents four papers, starting with a critical review of the role of frequencies in phonology and scaffolding up to phylogenetic tree inference using quantitative phonotactic data from 111 Pama-Nyungan languages. The central finding is that phonotactic frequency data, when combined with more traditional lexical cognate data, strengthens phylogenetic tree inference/does not strengthen phylogenetic tree inference but has some other interesting role to play. These studies lay the groundwork for a phonotactic phylogenetics research program which can be combined with other cross-linguistic and cross-disciplinary threads of evidence to illuminate gaps in human history throughout the Holocene.
