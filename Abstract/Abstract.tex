Human languages show immense structural variation across the globe. This structural variation we observe is the manifestation of thousands of years of diachronic processes. Through tracing these processes, we can infer the shared linguistic origins of different languages, a subfield of historical linguistics termed linguistic phylogenetics. In concert with evidence from other fields such as archaeology, ecology and anthropology, and utilising powerful computational methods from biology, it is possible piece together deep-time hypotheses on human history, i.e. who was talking to who, when, where and why.

A critical foundation in the methodological arsenal for tackling these questions is a sound understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of linguistic structures. Access to structural data at scale, including from resource-poor linguistic areas, will also be essential for progressing the field, which is still bottlenecked by the ‘pen and paper’ data acquisition methods of 20th century historical linguistics. My research concentrates on structural linguistic variation within sound systems—specifically, phonotactics (the language-specific set of rules that govern how sounds combine into words and syllables). I examine the evolutionary dynamics of quantitative data extracted from the wordlists of Australian Indigenous languages using a variety of computational phylogenetic methods. In this way, I hope to lay the groundwork for a phonotactic phylogenetics research program which can be combined with other cross-linguistic and cross-disciplinary threads of evidence to illuminate gaps in human history throughout the Holocene.
